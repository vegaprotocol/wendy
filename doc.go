// Package wendy is the reference implementation of [Wendy](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/885), the Good Little Fairness Widget.
// The project is still under development and it has NOT been tested in production.
// It properly handles transactions order via a voting system.
// It defines its own primitive types so that it remains independent from a
// particular blockchain implementation. Primitive types are simple and should
// satisfy most implementation.
